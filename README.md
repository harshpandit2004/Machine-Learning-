This is a repository hodling the code files i make to learn machine learning. 


model00 [15th July, 2023] : an unsuccessful attempt at creating the text color guesser on different color backgrounds on a react webapp.

model01-vanilla [15th July, 2023] : a training model which guesses the output of an XOR gate. Dumb app, agreed; but it helps understand the nitty gritty details on machine learining on a vanilla HTML/CSS/JS website. it guesses a float number but it is not "real" training if the user has to put in a kilometer of training data in as an array.

model02-BGC_Guesser [16th July, 2023]: A text color guesser on different color backgrounds. Hopefully i can implement "real" training this time.

# Machine Learning Code Repository

This repository contains code files I've created while learning machine learning concepts and techniques.

## Models:

### model00 - Text Color Guesser (Unsuccessful)
- Date: 15th July, 2023
- Description: An attempt to create a text color guesser for different color backgrounds on a React web app. Unfortunately, this attempt was unsuccessful.

### model01-vanilla - XOR Gate Output Guesser
- Date: 15th July, 2023
- Description: A training model that guesses the output of an XOR gate. The application is implemented using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It may seem simplistic, but it helps in understanding the fundamental concepts of machine learning. The model predicts a float number, but it lacks "real" training as the user has to input a considerable amount of training data in the form of an array.

### model02-BGC_Guesser - Improved Text Color Guesser
- Date: 16th July, 2023
- Description: An enhanced text color guesser for different color backgrounds. The goal is to implement "real" training this time to improve its performance and accuracy.
